There have been some star fantastic games Star Wars games over the years. 
Ranging from arcade classics to more modern success stories, 
fans of the greatest sci-fi franchise have had a lot to play 
over the years. A huge number of talented developers have brought 
the world of Jedis and Wookiees to life in the video game space, 
and whether you want to swing a lightsaber, pal around with Darth 
Vader or drive a pod racer there’s sure to be one you’ll love. My 
personal favourite though has to be Knights of the Old Republic. 
The sprawling Bioware RPG gave me everything I ever wanted from a
 Star Wars game, and if you missed it the first time around it’s 
 now available on the Switch.

While serving aboard the Republic ship The Endar Spire, our custom 
made amnesia-riddled hero finds themselves in the middle of a ferocious
attack from the Sith. After grabbing the last escape pod with new ally
Carth and landing on nearby planet Taris, an adventure to find a powerful 
  Jedi who went missing in the attack and save the galaxy begins. The story
   branches off in all sorts of intergalactic directions as you progress, but
    the one constant is that it’s always engaging.
