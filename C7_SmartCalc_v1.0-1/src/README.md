## SmartCalc v1.0

## Part 1. Calculation

The SmartCalc v1.0 program interface:

![Alt text](main_menu.png)

Available options:
- Both integers and real numbers with a dot can be input into the program.
- The calculation is done after you complete entering the calculating expression and press the `=` symbol.
- Calculating arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation
- Calculating arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation with substitution of the value of the variable _x_ as a number
- Plotting a graph of a function given by an expression in infix notation with the variable _x_ (with coordinate axes, mark of the used scale and an adaptive grid)
    - The scale can be set up before graph drawn
- Verifiable accuracy of the fractional part is 7 decimal places
- Users can enter up to 255 characters
- Bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation supports the following arithmetic operations and mathematical functions:
    - **Arithmetic operators**:

      | Operator name | Infix notation <br /> (Classic) | Prefix notation <br /> (Polish notation) |  Postfix notation <br /> (Reverse Polish notation) |
      | --------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
      | Brackets | (a + b) | (+ a b) | a b + |
      | Addition | a + b | + a b | a b + |
      | Subtraction | a - b | - a b | a b - |
      | Multiplication | a * b | * a b | a b * |
      | Division | a / b | / a b | a b \ |
      | Power | a ^ b | ^ a b | a b ^ |
      | Modulus | a mod b | mod a b | a b mod |
      | Unary plus | +a | +a | a+ |
      | Unary minus | -a | -a | a- |

    - **Functions**:
  
      | Function description | Function |
      | ------ | ------ |
      | Computes cosine | cos(x) |

      | Computes arc sine | asin(x) |
      | Computes arc tangent | atan(x) |
      | Computes square root | sqrt(x) |
      | Computes natural logarithm | ln(x) |
      | Computes common logarithm | log(x) |
